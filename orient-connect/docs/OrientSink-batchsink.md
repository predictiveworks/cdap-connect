# OrientDB Sink

Description
---
This is a batch connector plugin for writing structured records to an OrientDB graph database.
A structured record either describes a graph vertex or an edge. Use cases where records specify 
vertices and edges are currently not supported by this plugin.

OrientDB is a multi-model open source NoSQL DBMS that combines the power of information 
networks or graphs, and the flexibility of documents into one scalable, high-performance 
operational database.
