# ThingsBoard

[ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io) is an open-source IoT platform for device management, data collection, processing & visualization.

ThingsBoard ships with an [Apache Kafka Plugin](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/plugins/kafka) that lets you forward device specific real-time events to Apache Kafka, e.g. for data analysis purposes.

> You may be interested to leverage [Predictive Works.](https://predictiveworks.eu) Kafka connector to consume real-time events for complex event processing and data ingestion into an IoT-scale database.  

This data connector has been been built to send analyzed (asset or domain-specific) data back to ThingsBoard, e.g. for visualization.
