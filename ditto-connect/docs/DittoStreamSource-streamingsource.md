Description
---
This is an IOT specific streaming connector plugin to read Web socket real-time events
from Eclipse Ditto. This plugin is part of PredictiveWorks. IoT support and contributes
to its semantic abstraction approach.

Eclipse Ditto abstracts an IoT device into a digital twin and provides synchronous and 
asynchronous APIs to work with physical devices. Ditto is an IoT middleware to interact 
with real world assets via the digital twin pattern

Devices are integrated via device connectivity layers like Eclipse Hono or e.g. MQTT 
brokers like Eclipse Mosquitto. Digital twins managed by Ditto may either forward their 
changes or receive live commands to actuate.
