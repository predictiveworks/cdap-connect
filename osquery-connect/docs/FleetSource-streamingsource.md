# Fleet Source

Description
---
This is a Cyber Defense specific streaming connector plugin, based on Works Stream, to read real-time
endpoint query events published by a Fleet (Osquery) endpoint management platform, and to transform them
into structured data flow records.

Fleet is an Osquery-based endpoint management platform that supports deploying, managing and scaling
endpoint fleets with 100,000+ devices.

PredictiveWorks supports multiple approaches to connect to Osquery-based endpoints (query) events.
These events define a first-class starting point to monitor endpoints of an enterprise network and 
apply advanced analytics to e.g. detect anomalous behavior.
